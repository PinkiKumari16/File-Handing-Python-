python class and objects
we have already discussed in previous tutorial,
a class is a virtual entity and can be seen as a blueprint of an object.
the class came into existence when it instatiated. 
let's understand it by an example.
on the other hand the object is the instance of a class.
the process of creating an object can be called instantiation.
in this section of the tutorial
we will discuss creating classes and objects in python .
we will also discuss how a class attribute is accessed by using the object.
